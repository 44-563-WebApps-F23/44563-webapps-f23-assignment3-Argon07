    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I'm a passionate individual who loves exploring new places and trying different cuisines. One interesting fact about me is that I have visited over 10 countries in the last five years, and I'm always planning my next adventure.
    </p>

    <h2>Favorite Food</h2>
    <p>
        My all-time favorite food is Paneer Tikka. There's something about the combination of fresh Paneer, perfectly seasoned veggies, and a touch of spices that I find absolutely irresistible. The variety of flavors and textures in Paneer Tikka is simply amazing.
        Whether it's traditional Paneer Tikka, creative rolls, or sashimi, I appreciate the artistry and taste of Paneer dishes. The balance of flavors and the aesthetic presentation make it a culinary delight that I can't get enough of.
