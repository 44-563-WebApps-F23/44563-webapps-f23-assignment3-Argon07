    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I'm a passionate individual who loves exploring new places and trying different cuisines. One interesting fact about me is that I have visited over 10 countries in the last five years, and I'm always planning my next adventure.

    <h2>Favorite Food</h2>
    <p>
        My all-time favorite food is Paneer Tikka. There's something about the combination of fresh Paneer, perfectly seasoned veggies. The variety of flavors and textures in Paneer Tikka is simply amazing.

        Whether it's traditional nigiri, creative rolls, or sashimi, I appreciate the artistry and taste of Paneer. The balance of flavors and the aesthetic presentation make it a culinary delight that I can't get enough of.
